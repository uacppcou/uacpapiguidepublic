## Introduction

Here is an example of edit

The SAP Help Portal provides the `Search` API and `Content` API to access its contents from applications or Web sites.

Here is a new parameter.
Adding a list:
- this is a new line
- add another line
- another test for notification


With the Search API, you can retrieve a list of documents according to the search parameters you have specified. Clicking on one of the search hits opens the document in the UACP viewer. The Content API however, retrieves the content itself which can then be viewed in a viewer of your choice.![](loiode1762692e0340f097bedc8984d4064a_LowRes.png)

In both cases, you can use the APIs for providing a context-sensitive help in your application, or for offering the information on a Web site.
